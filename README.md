# Back-to-Top-Button - HTML5 & CSS3

The sticky back-to-top button is a helpful navigation element that helps users get back to the top of the web page they’re viewing. A common UI pattern is to place this button in the lower right-hand corner of the screen, making it “sticky” via a fixed position so it’s always accessible as the user scrolls down the page.
